Description: PEP 3156 event loop based on GLib (Python 3)
 Gbulb is a Python library that implements a PEP 3156 interface for the GLib
 main event loop under UNIX-like systems. As much as possible, except where
 noted, it mimics asyncio's interface.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
